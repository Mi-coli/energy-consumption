# Energy Consumption Prediction Using Time-Series Data

In this project, I aim to predict the energy consumption for a specific region using historical time-series data. The dataset contains energy usage values measured in megawatts, which are crucial for understanding patterns and making informed decisions in energy management.

The objective of this analysis is to develop a model capable of forecasting future energy consumption based on past trends. Time-series forecasting is a powerful tool for providing insights into trends and seasonality, which are important in various domains, including energy, finance, and demand planning.

This notebook demonstrates the process of time-series forecasting, from data exploration and feature engineering to model development and evaluation. Time-series data requires specific handling due to its temporal structure, making this task both challenging and valuable for accurate predictions.
